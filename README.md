# FileGrid

**FileGrid** is a visual file management system that lets you drag and drop files onto a spatial canvas, where they can be freely organized, previewed, and zoomed in/out. It's built for users who want a more intuitive, visual way of managing filesâ€”kind of like a digital whiteboard for your documents.

You can check it out @ https://filegrid.web.app/

*Can only be controlled via trackpad, additional usability updates coming soon!
